Given a list saved in a variable: 
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new 
list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
    evens = ([b for b in a if b % 2 == 0])
    print(evens)

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
(Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, 
print out a message of congratulations to the winner, 
and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
