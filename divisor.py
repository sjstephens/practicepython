Task #1 divisors
Asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

'''
Task 2)
Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. 
(For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.).
